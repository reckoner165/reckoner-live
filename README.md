Live coding setup, code from past performances and half-ideas
All of the code is written for [TidalCycles](https://tidalcycles.org/Welcome), [FoxDot](https://foxdot.org/) or [Hydra](https://foxdot.org/).

`outlet` contains some of the code written while performing for my [Outlet](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgySrqiJduxZOAYvoEH4hj6L5RXf6tMv2) series on Youtube.  

`performances` contains code from old algoraves and other shows.
