# reckoner-live

This repo contains a corpus of code related to the [Reckoner](https://reckoner.space/).

Reckoner is a New York-based computer-songwriter project by Sumanth Srinivasan. Drawing from krautrock, trip hop and glitch, his music is a fusion of live sampling, guitar, live coded rhythms and melodic vocals. Reckoner has released a full length album, several EPs and recently performed a series of shows in Europe.

All of the code is written for [TidalCycles](https://tidalcycles.org/Welcome), [FoxDot](https://foxdot.org/), [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/) or [Hydra](https://foxdot.org/).

`outlet` contains some of the code written while performing for my [Outlet](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgySrqiJduxZOAYvoEH4hj6L5RXf6tMv2) series on Youtube.

`performances` contains code from old algoraves and other shows (solo, Reckoner x Kastakila and Archaic Reckoner).

`rehearsals` contains code from rehearsals

`utils` contains some Tidal utilities that I frequently use

`ideas` is a disorganized collection of ideas, sketches and tests
